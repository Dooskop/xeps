  <title>Server to Server communication over STANAG 5066 ARQ</title>
  <abstract>
  This specification defines operation over XMPP over the NATO STANAG 5066 data link service for point to point links (ARQ).   
  This enables optimized XMPP performance over HF Radio (which STANAG 5066 was designed for) and over other data links using STANAG 5066.

<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
   This specification arose from requirements to operate over HF Radio, which has exceedingly high latency (sometimes minutes) low data rates (down to 75 bits/second) 
   and poor reliablity.

    </note>
 is a widely used HF link level protocol.   Direct use of <strong>STANAG 5066</strong> enables elimination of all extraneous end to end handshaking, which is important 
    to optimize performance.  It also enables use of <strong>STANAG 5066</strong> flow control, which is important for resilience.
 </p>
  <p>
    The solution uses the streaming service specified by 
    <span class='ref'><link url='https://www.isode.com/whitepapers/S5066-APP3.html'>SLEP</link></span> 
    <note>SIS Layer Extension Protocol (SLEP) (S5066-APP3) &lt;<link url='https://www.isode.com/whitepapers/S5066-APP3.html'>https://www.isode.com/whitepapers/S5066-APP3.html</link>&gt;.
    </note> - SIS Layer Extension Protocol.   <strong>SLEP</strong> specifies three layer services that operate over STANAG 5066, including a streaming service which
    provides an equivalent service to TCP.   <strong>SLEP</strong> also provides compression, which is mandated for use by this specification.    
  </p>
<p>
  The solution is based on &xep0361; and requires peer configuration to be established according to <strong>XEP-0361</strong>.  The data exchanged between the XMPP servers 
  follows exactly what is specified in <strong>XEP-0361</strong>.    The data is transferred using <strong>SLEP</strong> rather than using TCP.   

</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>
    This specification can be considered as a profile for server to server XMPP communication, to enable XMPP deployment over HF Radio using <strong>STANAG 5066</strong>.   
    This profile MUST only be used where its use has been pre-agreed and configured for both participating servers.
  </p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <p>
    An example scenario where this protocol is important is where two ships connected by HF Surface Wave communication only need to exchange XMPP messages. 
    A reliable link (Soft Link) can be established using <strong>STANAG 5066</strong> and XMPP communicated efficiently and reliably over <strong>SLEP</strong>.

  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Business Rules' anchor='rules'>

  <section2 topic="General Operation">
  <p>
    Because of potentially very low bandwidth sending server MAY perform traffic optimisation, such as selective removal of stanzas that are not adding sufficient value, like CSNs, or strip selected elements such as xhtml-im.
  </p>
    <p>
      Applications sending data over <strong>STANAG 5066</strong> need to be aware of increased delays and any application level timers (e.g., IQ response timers) need to be set accordingly.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      &xep0198; MAY be used over <strong>SLEP</strong>.  Although reliability of stanza transfer is provided by use of <strong>STANAG 5066</strong> and <strong>SLEP</strong>, use of 
      &xep0198; is RECOMMENDED to monitor link latency. 
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Application-layer keepalives such as white-space pings are NOT RECOMMENDED.
    </p>

  </section2>

<section2 topic="Mapping onto SLEP">
  <p>
    The stanza stream is transferred using <strong>SLEP</strong>.  <strong>SLEP</strong> compression is mandatory.

  </p>


</section2>
  <section2 topic="Addressing">
    <p>
  The peer addressing of the <strong>STANAG 5066</strong> end points will be configured as part of the <strong>XEP-0361</strong> peer agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>STANAG 5066</strong> SAP MAY be set to any mutually agreed value.   It is RECOMMENDED that 6 is used which is the value 
      specified in  <strong>STANAG 5066</strong> for use by this XEP.
    </p>
  </section2>
</section1>


<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>
    Security Considerations of <strong>XEP-0361</strong> apply.   <strong>STANAG 5066</strong> will frequently be employed in conjunction with link level crypto devices, which SHOULD be done when appropriate to provide data confidentiality.
