<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
    <p>The &xep0045; specification does not provide for a mechanism whereby an user might be informed of being mentioned in a Multi-User Chat (MUC) without being present as an occupant of that MUC.</p>
    <p>This XEP aims to provide a standardized way in which this might be achieved.</p>
    <p>Concerning "being mentioned" in a MUC, we will rely on &xep0372; as the means whereby someone is explicitly mentioned in a MUC message.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>A user's client must be able to receive forwarded groupchat messages from a MUC in which that user is mentioned, while not having an active session in that MUC (i.e. without joining it).</p>
  <p>For this to be possible, the MUC needs to know the user's JID and MUC nickname even when that user is not currently present in the MUC. &xep0045; section 7.10 ("Registering with a Room") describes a mechanism whereby a user can register a nickname with a MUC and it is recommended that this is the mechanism used to keep track of users across sessions.</p>
  <p>Whether or not mesages are forwarded will be determined by a configuration setting on the MUC.</p>
  <p>The MUC owner(s) will therefore determine whether notifications are sent out, and if activated, users may opt in or out (or have that done for them by a privileged user) by having their nicknames registered or not with the MUC.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>

  <section2 topic='A MUC is configured to send out mention notifications'>
    <p>When an owner creates or configures a MUC, the service offers the option to send out mention notifications to non-present, but still affiliated users:</p>
    <example caption='Service Sends Configuration Form'><![CDATA[

    <p>The owner specifies a value of "1" or "true" &BOOLEANNOTE; if the feature is desired:</p>

  <section2 topic='Notifying a non-present user of being mentioned in a MUC'>
    <p>When an affiliated user in a given MUC is referenced in a 'groupchat' message via &xep0372;, and the MUC is configured to forward mentions, then the MUC will forward the message stanza to the user.</p>
    <example caption='MUC forwards the message to the users client'><![CDATA[
<message to='hag66@shakespeare.lit' from='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit'>
  <mentions xmlns='urn:xmpp:mmn:0'>
    <forwarded xmlns='urn:xmpp:forward:0'>
      <delay xmlns='urn:xmpp:delay' stamp='2020-12-03T14:45:56Z'/>
      <message type='groupchat' id='ad22c55c-5a20-4185-8735-af2eb8d459a9'
          to='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit'
          from='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit/firstwitch'
          xml:lang='en'>
        <body>secondwitch: Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.</body>
        <reference xmlns='urn:xmpp:reference:0'
            type='mention'
            begin='0'
            uri='xmpp:hag66@shakespeare.lit'
            end='11'/>
        <stanza-id xmlns='urn:xmpp:sid:0'
                   id='5f3dbc5e-e1d3-4077-a492-693f3769c7ad'
                   by='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit'/>
      </message>
    </forwarded>
  </mentions>
</message>
]]></example>
    <p>Notice that in the example above, the entire original 'groupchat' message (including elements added server-side, like the &xep0359; stanza-id) is encapsulated inside a &xep0279; element.</p>
  </section2>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>Similarly to &xep0280;, the security model assumed by this document is that all of the resources for a single user are in the same trust boundary.</p>
  <p>Forwarded groupchat messages leak information of who is currently present in a MUC without requiring the user to join the MUC first to find out.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any forwarded copies received by a client MUST be from a valid MUC JID which matches the MUC JID of the encapsulated, forwarded mesages;</li>
    <li>any copies that do not meet this requirement MUST be ignored.</li>
  </ul>
